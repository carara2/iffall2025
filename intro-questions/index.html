        1. I'm Carolyn Tang, a senior majoring in design and finance.

        2. I am a BA in design and have done both communication and fashion design. Although my interests have focused more on the fashion design side recently, I took this class interested in learning about CSS/HTML's versatility as a language. I look forward to typing in my past experiences in communication design & HCI as layer to a more techincally-focused skill -building course.

        3. I was briefly introduced to some HTML/CSS basics in Human-Computer Interaction club, but have little familiarity otherwise.
    <p>

        4. I hope to reach a level of familiarity with different types of HTML/CSS functions, to the point where I am comfortable envisioning and executing a design, focusing on a larger picture aside from the specific technicalities.

        5. I'd expect designing for the screen to be a lot different from designing for paper, especially when working with collapsible text widths (like when dragging the side of the tab and the text width has to adjust accordingly).

        6. The Pantone website has an especially satisfying and well-done design: https://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year/2025. It is designed well in the sense that its visual elements are very carefully considered and laid out to be appealing, well-organized, and satisfying to look at. The images feature rich shades of the color being highlighted in multiple color palettes, the headers and body text are set up with effective contrast, and its setup becomes more and more unique and creative as you scroll down.

        7. The European Capital of culture website is an example that exemplifies effective communication: https://www.go2025.eu/en. This webiste was a part of the Business of Arts study abroad program in which we were introduced to the organization's theme and goals before visiting the site in person. Having little understanding of what their goals were beforehand, we were given this website to become more acquainted with the context. It includes multiple tabs and buttons to redirect the user to a general overview, an event toolbar, links to projects, news, and further program resources all laid on on one page in precise and clear language that makes it easy to interact.

        8. A website I believe works well is pinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/. Its search function pulls up relevant "pins" that appear on the page in a visually appealing, sized format where the user can scroll through each and interact with different engagement functions. The layout is visually appealing, easy, and effective to engage with.
