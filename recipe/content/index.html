<p>Meanwhile, pat chicken dry with paper towels; season all over with salt and pepper.</p>
<p>Lay two slices of prosciutto beside each other on a work surface. Place a chicken culet along bottom of slices: tightly roll up prosciutto around chicken. Repeat with remaining prosciutto and chicken.</p>

<h3>3 Sear Chicken</h3>
<p>Heat a drizzle of olive oil in pan used for panko over medium-high heat. Add wrapped chicken and cook until browned, 2-3 minutes per side (it'll finish cooking in the next step). TIP: If your pan isn't ovenproof, transfer chicken to a baking sheet now.</p>

<p>Top chicken with Swiss cheese; transfer pan to oven. Roast on top rack until chicken is cooked through and cheese has melted, 10-15 minutes.</p>
<p>Turn off haet; transfer chicekn to a cutting board to rest. Reserve pan.</p>

<p>Turn off heat and stir in 1 Tbsp plain butter (2 Tbsp for 4 servings) unil melted. Taste and season with salt and pepper. TIP: if needed, stir in more pasta cooking water a splas at a time until pasta is caoted in a creamy sauce.</p>

<h3>7 Finish & Serve</h3>
<p>Slice chicken crosswise.</p>
<p>Divide pasta between plates. Top with toasted panko and chicken. Serve. TIP: if you prefer, serve chicken alongside the pasta instead.</p>

<h2>Recipe websites</h2>
<p>1.<a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/easy-to-love-chicken-thighs-and-couscous">Bon Appetit</a> Includes distinct sections with clear descriptions, imagery for each tool, and tags at bottom to identify recipe categories. Could have better formatting for ingredients list and more separation between numbers and units for each.</p>
<p>2.<a href="https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/pumpkin-muffins.html">once upon a chef</a> Has large, immersive images and videos, distinctly great use of design and contrast for ingredients list. Images and steps for cooking process take up a lost of space and require a lot of scrolling, however.</p>
<p>3.<a href="https://pinchofyum.com/roasted-red-pepper-pasta">pinch of yum</a> Checkable ingredients list that gets crossed out is excellent and useful. Nutritional facts and section headers to divide up website are useful and functional.</p>

<h2>Non-recipe websites</h2>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.animusstudios.com/">Animus Studios</a> Example that uses distinct website sectioning, transitioning between light and dark imagery divides while scrolling. Text is large, distinct, and appealing.</p>
<p>2. <a href="https://lowfivebrewing.com/en">Low Five Brewing</a> Website that has a great layout in being able to condense everything compactly, while also displaying content concisely. Tabs that show each drink that pop out with greater details is an interesting experimental concept, although may not be as effective for a recipe website. Maybe for nutrition information?</p>
<p>3. <a href="https://climateprimer.mit.edu/">Climate Science, Risk & Solutions</a> Uses a singular consistent background theme, clearly sectioned with numbered tabs. Informational dominant content that also isn't overwhelming, and navigation guide at bottom clarifies how to interact with website.</p>
